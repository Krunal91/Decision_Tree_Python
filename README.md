# Decision Tree Python
This project implements decision tree in python. In this project, I am using information gain as a splitting criteria.

### File names and Descriptions  

####  * decision_tree.py  
This is main python file.To run this project, one just have to run this files. All the function calls to different files will be made from this main python file.

#### dataset_details.py  
This function loads the data from input data folder and process the data to make it appropriate for the decision tree algorithms.

#### information_gain.py  
This file contains the implementation of splitting criteria named information gain.

#### prediction.py  
This file uses the already built structure to predit the class for new data.
